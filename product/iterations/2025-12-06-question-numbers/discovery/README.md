# Iteration Discovery: 2025-12-06-question-numbers

**Started**: 2025-12-06
**Focus**: Users can't tell what number question they are on: Questions don't have numbers, so it's hard to keep track of your position in the survey.
**Status**: Active

## Goals
Add sequential question numbering to all 19 survey questions to help users track their position and reduce confusion. Format: "Question X of 19" positioned to the left of each question on both mobile and desktop.

## Research Methods
- [x] AI-guided stakeholder interview (Steve, 2025-12-06)
- [ ] Technical observations
- [ ] Additional research as needed

## Timeline
- **Start**: 2025-12-06
- **Target synthesis**: TBD
- **Urgency**: High (user complaints driving this)

## Key Decisions
- **Numbering format**: "Question 3 of 19" (not just "3" or "3/19")
- **Position**: Left of question text
- **Scope**: All question types (Likert, multi-select, ranking, open-ended)
- **Coverage**: Mobile and desktop
- **Sequential**: 1-19, no conditional logic
- **Out of scope**: Progress bars, section headers, skip logic

## Notes
- Driven by user feedback/complaints about confusion
- No existing progress indication in current survey
- Success metric: Reduction in complaints
- All users affected, not just a segment
- Need to maintain consistency across all question types
