# Interview: Sarah Aslanifar

**Date:** 2025-11-13 (15:15)
**Interviewer:** Mike Mitchell
**Persona:** Survey taker (conference attendee providing feedback)

## Participant Background
- **Role**: Principal Engineer at Equal Experts
- **Experience**: 4+ years at Equal Experts; extensive conference speaking/attending (more active before joining)
- **Context**: Equal Experts consultant regularly attending industry conferences as speaker and attendee; experienced with post-event survey processes

## Pain Points and Problem Areas

### 1. Mandatory Fields Without Content
- **Quote**: "There are sometimes fields that it's like you must enter something and if you don't have any feedback on that, it doesn't let you proceed. Those are frustrating because at this point, things should be optional."
- **Context**: Completing post-conference surveys encountering required fields for topics without specific feedback
- **Frequency**: "Sometimes" - recurring across multiple survey experiences
- **Impact**:
  - Severity: Medium
  - Consequences: Forces fabricated responses or survey abandonment
  - Emotional: Frustration with restrictive survey design
- **Current Workaround**: Abandons survey or provides meaningless responses
- **Real Goal**: Provide honest, authentic feedback only where meaningful input exists

### 2. Survey Abandonment Due to Length
- **Quote**: "Sometimes they're too long. Or those that are very long. I do that."
- **Context**: When surveys exceed attention span threshold
- **Frequency**: "Several times" - abandoned multiple surveys
- **Impact**:
  - Severity: High
  - Consequences: No feedback provided; conference organizers lose valuable input
  - Emotional: Gives up partway through
- **Current Workaround**: Complete abandonment
- **Real Goal**: Provide feedback within reasonable time investment (under 5 minutes)

### 3. Restrictive Answer Choices
- **Quote**: "Other ones that it's exactly the situation I mentioned. Like, they're too restrictive. I had to choose one and another or I cannot move forward."
- **Context**: When survey options don't reflect actual experience or opinion
- **Frequency**: Multiple occurrences leading to abandonment
- **Impact**:
  - Severity: High
  - Consequences: Survey abandonment; loss of nuanced feedback
  - Emotional: Frustration with inability to express true opinion
- **Current Workaround**: Abandons survey rather than providing inaccurate response
- **Real Goal**: Express authentic feedback reflecting actual experience

### 4. Lack of Feedback Acknowledgement
- **Quote**: "Close to none" when asked about seeing what happens with feedback
- **Context**: After investing time completing surveys, receives no follow-up or indication feedback was valued
- **Frequency**: Nearly universal experience
- **Impact**:
  - Severity: Medium
  - Consequences: Reduces motivation for future survey participation
  - Emotional: Feels unvalued; questions if effort was worthwhile
- **Current Workaround**: Continues participating based on hope rather than evidence
- **Real Goal**: Understand that input is valued and considered

## Unmet Needs

### 1. Immediate Feedback Timing
- **Need Statement**: Ability to provide session-specific feedback immediately after each session while memory is fresh
- **Context**: Capture accurate impressions before details fade or confuse with other sessions
- **Type**: Quality requirement (defines "good" feedback)
- **Associated with Pain?**: No - enabling better quality feedback

- **Associated with Pain?**: Yes - addresses restrictive answer choices pain point
- **Success Criteria**: Each multiple choice question has optional text field

### 4. Question-Specific Commentary
- **Need Statement**: Ability to add explanatory text directly adjacent to each question rather than only at survey end
- **Context**: When she has specific context or reasoning for answer choice
- **Type**: Enabling capability
- **Priority**: Preferred over catch-all comment boxes
- **Success Criteria**: Optional text field per question section

### 5. Human Acknowledgement of Feedback
- **Need Statement**: Confirmation that a real person reviewed feedback, not just automated "thank you for your submission"
- **Quote**: "Even if they don't use my feedback, just knowing that someone took the time to read that and consider it"

- **Exploration vs Commitment**: High priority/ready to commit
- **Quote**: "A true acknowledgement, not just we've received your survey or thank you for that. Like a follow up that, hey, we read that"

### 2. Surprise Recognition Over Incentives
- **Aspiration Statement**: Unexpected post-feedback appreciation rather than pre-announced incentives
- **Inspiration Source**: Past positive experience with company sending surprise thank-you package weeks after interview feedback
- **Why It Excites Them**: Feels more genuine and rewarding than transactional incentives
- **Quote**: "That's the element of surprise that it's after and not because of it… It's afterwards that's more rewarding than going into it knowing that I will get something"
- **Exploration vs Commitment**: Interested concept but not required

### 3. Results Transparency

## Current Workflow

### Workflow Name: Post-Conference Feedback Provision

**Trigger**: Receipt of survey link after conference attendance

**Goal**: Provide honest, helpful feedback to improve future conferences

**Steps**:

1. **Immediate Session Feedback** (if available)
   - Actions: Complete session-specific surveys right after session ends
   - Tools/systems: Whatever platform provided by conference
   - Time required: Quick completion while memory fresh
   - Decision points: Whether session had memorable positive/negative aspects worth noting

2. **Overall Conference Assessment**
   - Actions: Wait for overall survey availability; typically complete during travel home
   - Tools/systems: Phone or computer depending on survey design and availability
   - Time required: Target under 5 minutes total
   - Decision points: Whether conference was worthwhile enough to merit feedback effort

3. **Participation Decision Making**
   - Actions: Evaluate survey design and requirements as encountered
   - Decision points: Will she continue if required fields too restrictive or survey too long?
   - Blockers/friction: Mandatory fields without relevant feedback, overly long surveys, restrictive answer choices

4. **Completion or Abandonment**
   - Actions: Either completes survey or abandons if friction too high
   - Completion Criteria: Successfully submits all feedback she wants to provide
   - Variations: May abandon partway through if survey becomes too demanding

**Pain Points in Workflow**: Mandatory fields, excessive length, restrictive choices, lack of acknowledgement

**What's Missing**: Immediate session feedback capability, flexible question formats, human acknowledgement of input

## Feature Reactions

### 1. Conditional Required Explanations
- **Initial Reaction**: Positive
- **Would they use it?**: Yes
- **Rationale**: "One thing that I also really appreciate is one of the conferences I've been to… if you read the speaker or the conference low, say three or lower, then we had to put an explanation"
- **Additional Context**: Sees value in forced explanation for negative ratings rather than blanket required fields

### 2. Incentive-Based Survey Completion
- **Initial Reaction**: Negative/skeptical
- **Would they use it?**: No
- **Rationale**: "I'm not big on that incentive stuff because it almost looks fishy… It almost feels the pressure to rate me good"
- **Concerns**: Worried incentives compromise feedback authenticity and create pressure for positive ratings

## Memorable Quotes

> "What motivates me, if I really enjoyed the conference, and I hope that I can see a plus sides to it… I am looking forward to attend. And I know that there are things that I can do to help them, motivate them or give them feedback that makes it even better."

> "More than five minutes" - her threshold for survey length tolerance

> "I prefer that it should be part of that question. So, like, multiple choice followed by a small optional thing to write down"

> "Close to none" - frequency of seeing what happens with feedback provided

> "Even if they don't use my feedback, just knowing that someone took the time to read that and consider it, that makes me want to finish the survey."

> "That's the element of surprise that it's after and not because of it… It's afterwards that's more rewarding than going into it knowing that I will get something."

## Behavioral Observations

- **Pragmatic about time**: Sets clear 5-minute limit; abandons surveys exceeding this threshold
- **Values authenticity**: Prefers abandoning survey rather than providing inaccurate responses to required fields
- **Quality-focused**: Wants to provide feedback immediately while memory is fresh for accuracy
- **Relationship-oriented**: Feedback motivation strongly tied to feeling conference organizers genuinely care about improvement
- **Experience-based decision making**: Uses past conference enjoyment to determine whether to invest time in feedback
- **Flexible on delivery method**: Comfortable with phone or computer depending on survey accessibility
- **Appreciates thoughtful design**: Responds positively to conditional requirements that serve a clear purpose
- **Skeptical of transactional approaches**: Views incentives as potentially compromising authenticity

## Follow-up Questions

1. What specific types of session feedback would be most valuable to capture immediately vs. in overall conference survey?
