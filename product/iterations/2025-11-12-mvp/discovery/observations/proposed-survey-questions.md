## Implementation Notes

### For Development Team

1. **All questions optional**: CRITICAL - Zero mandatory fields. All 19 questions must be skippable to prevent abandonment. This is a hard requirement from attendee interviews.

2. **Optional comment boxes**: 12 questions have optional text boxes for additional context. These should always be visible but clearly marked as optional.

3. **Progress indicator**: Show "Question X of 19" to help users track progress through the survey.

4. **Save draft**: Allow users to save and return if they need to pause.

5. **Acknowledgment page**: Immediately confirm "Thank you - your feedback has been received and will be reviewed by conference organizers." This addresses the "black hole effect" concern from attendee interviews.

6. **Transparency placement**: Show transparency notes beneath each question in smaller, lighter text.

7. **Choice ranking (Q11)**: Implement drag-to-reorder or dropdown assignment (1-4) for session format preferences.

8. **Multiple select checkboxes**: Q4 (connection quality), Q17 (feedback confidence) allow multiple selections.

9. **N/A handling**: Q3 (coworking day), Q8 (Saturday), Q10 (accommodations/venue), Q13 (comparison) include N/A option.

10. **CSV export**: Ensure all fields export cleanly with proper column headers for demographic analysis (critical for Lauren's segmentation needs).

11. **In-conference context**: All questions assume completion before attendees leave - no post-conference action questions.

12. **Mobile responsive**: Survey must work well on phones - attendees will complete during conference break on mobile devices.
