# Iteration Discovery: 2025-12-06-sandbox-js1

**Started**: 2025-12-06
**Focus**: Jeremy temporary testing of the product iteration process
**Status**: Complete (sandbox)

## Goals
- Learn the product iteration framework before real feature work
- Practice the interview/discovery process
- Understand how to create robust stories (1-3) for a small dev team

## Research Methods
- [x] AI-guided stakeholder interview

## Timeline
- **Start**: 2025-12-06
- **Completed**: 2025-12-06

## Key Decisions
1. Scope limited to interview process + story creation (no story mapping or Jira integration needed)
2. Identified webhooks as the feature for the next real iteration
3. Team preference: backend-focused features

## Findings

### Framework Feedback
- Freeform Q&A format works well - can be shaped in real time
- No gaps identified in the process

### Next Iteration
- Feature: Response webhooks (POST to external URL when surveys submitted)
- Rationale: Backend-focused, interesting to present, practical scope for small team
